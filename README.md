## How to dev ?

If you have any ideas to improve the project, you can create a branch, edit the ROADMAP.md by adding any feature you think would be interesting.

When you want to dev a feature, create a new branch, `git checkout -b feature/<feature-title>`.

On this branch, the first thing you must do is to update the ROADMAP.md file by replacing the minus by a plus.

Then, you must update the UPDATES.md file. This file helps tracking what has been done on each version.
